# road-lane-detection-project
A computer vision project for detecting road lanes in real-time video streams. This project makes use of OpenCV, a popular open-source computer vision library, to process video frames and identify the road lanes.

Requirements
The following packages must be installed to run the code:

OpenCV
Numpy
Matplotlib
Output
The code outputs a video file named Lane.mp4 in the same directory, showing the detected road lanes overlaid on the original video.
